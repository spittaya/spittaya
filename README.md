### Hi! I'm Sirada, here's a little about me ðŸ‘‹

I'm an avid leaner, an imaginative problem solver and a data-driven professional. 

#### What I've been up to ðŸŒ±:
I recently joined a data science fellowship with Correlation One. My team and I are working towards studying the effects of COVID-19 on small businesses - specifically looking into factors that may influnece expected recovery rate. I'm learning a lot about the statistical background in machine learning, deep neural nets, causal inference - and the list goes on. 

#### What I care about ðŸ‘¯: 
I'm a big advocate for diversity in STEM, youth mentorship and data equity. I believe that diversity of thought and data equity are key contributors in building a product or a solution that doesn't just work, but serves the community. I am also a big believer in paying it forward and doing what I can to give back to my community, whether that be through pro-bono consulting projects or mentoring youth. 

#### My Interests âœ¨:
Driving decisions with data through impactful insights, building products/solutions that is needed and desired by the user, finding my next favourite coffee shop in the city.
